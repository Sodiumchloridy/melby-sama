## 1. Setup

### 1. Install Poetry

You can install Poetry by following the official [installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

```bash
pip install poetry
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true # to create the virtual environment in the project directory
```

### 2. Setup the environment variables

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project with the following variables:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=
SPEECH_KEY=
SPEECH_REGION=
```

You can get your own `GEMINI_API_KEY` at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

You can get the `SPEECH_KEY` and `SPEECH_REGION` by following the steps below:

1. Sign up for an Azure free account at [https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services).
2. [Create a Speech Services resource](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesSpeechServices) in the Azure Portal.
3. Get the `SPEECH_KEY` and `SPEECH_REGION` from the resource.

### 3. Run the project
At the root of the project, run:

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py
```

### 4. Set up VTube Studio
1. Downlaod and launch [VTube Studio](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1325860/VTube_Studio/).
2. Optional (Advanced) : Port the model's output audio into microphone input of Vtube Studio via [Voicemeeter Banana](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm) and [VB Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/).

### 5. Set up OBS Studio
1. Add VTube Studio as Game Capture to source.
2. Add `src/temp/subtitles.txt` as Text to source.
3. If you previously set up Voicemeeter and VB Cable in Step 4.2, you'll need to configure it here too.
